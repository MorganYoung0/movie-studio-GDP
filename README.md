### Data Summary

This is a small data set with commercial details for various films.

### Problem Statement

There isn't an easy to understand, informative visualisaion of how much of a % of the gross domestic box office revenue each different genre takes. This means there's very little the industry can do in terms of analysis on any problems, to spot any falling or rising genres to capitalise on.

### Solution

I performed some analysis and produced a visualisation illustrating the domestic gross box office revenue (measure of movie success) for each movie, per movie studio, by genre. This has been visualised as a boxplot overlaid with a scatterplot to indicate the distribution of the films themselves whilst still clearly showing the range of domestic gross box office revenue (as a %) that each of the genres are taking as a result of the films that fall underneath them.
